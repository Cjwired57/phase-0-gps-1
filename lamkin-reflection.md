GPS 1.1 Reflection


What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Although I was pretty solid on version control/git before my GPS session, I was a little unclear on what exactly was going on with the git fetch origin master and git merge origin master...I didn't realize that these were included in the git pull command and was confused by the terminology.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The above git pull/git fetch/git merge process was cleared up for me during the GPS.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
We really breezed through the challenge itself but afterwards had a great discussion on what optimal git workflow should look like.


What still confuses you about git?
I had one problem where I could only see a certain repo, in my terminal, when I was on a new feature branch which was extremely confusing but then I realized that I had never gone back and merged with master branch so in the end it made a lot of sense.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Had an awesome first GPS experience, my partner and I went through the challenge very smoothly and our guide was incredibly helpful in providing us additional things to think about and leading discussion after the main challenge was complete.
